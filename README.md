- Installing, configuring, and managing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), including creating and managing a large number of user accounts
- Writing and executing scripts to automate the creation and management of users in Active Directory
- Setting up and configuring virtual machines and virtual network environments using Oracle VirtualBox
- Configuring network settings, including IP addressing and DNS, to ensure proper connectivity and secure communication between virtual machines
- Managing server roles and features, performing regular maintenance tasks, and monitoring system performance and health

### Tools Used
- Oracle Virtual Box used for housing our entire network, server, and client machine.
- Windows Server 2019 ISO for installing the server to the Virtual box to house Active Directory.
- Windows 10 Disk Image ISO for installing the client machine to the Virtual box to access the internal network.
